## Chapter 1 - Introduction to Computers and Programming 
### How Computers Work
##### What is a program?
+ A program is a set of instructions.
+ The instructions are a colleciton of algorithms. 
+ Algorithms are a set of steps to find solutions to a problem.

##### What is data?
+ Information
+ Numbers
+ Text
+ Images
+ Videos

##### How does a computer work?

###### Components 
+ CPU: Central Processing Unit
+ ALU: Arithemitic Logic Unit
+ Control Unit
+ Memory
+ Input 
+ Output

###### What are examples of Operating Systems?
+ Linux
+ Mac OS
+ Windows

###### What are some examples of input devices? 
+ Keyboard
+ Scanner
+ Mouse
+ Flash Drives 

###### What are some examples of output devices?
+ Monitor
+ Printer 
+ Flash Drives
+ Audio Interface

##### Binary Code - Machine Code 
###### What is Binary Code?
+ 1 bit = one binary digit. 
+ 1 byte = eight bits. Written as: 01010010 
+ Example 1: In C++ 1 word is uses 4 bytes of memory. 

##### Programming Languages 
There are two main kinds of programming languages, High Level Languages and Low Level Languages.
+ High Level Language: A machine-independent programming language, such as C, C++, Java, Perl and COBOL. It lets the programmer concentrate on the logic of the problem to be solved rather than the intricacies of the machine architecture such as is required with low-level assembly languages.
+ Low Level Language:  a low-level programming language is a programming language that provides little or no abstraction from a computer's instruction set architectureâ€”commands or functions in the language map closely to processor instructions. Generally this refers to either machine code or assembly language.

###### Different Aspects of a Programming Language
1. Keywords (Reserved Words)
2. Programmer defined identifiers (ex. variables)
3. Operators (Arithemitic Operating)
4. Punctuations
5. Syntax 
6. Libraries (files written by others usually installed or included)
7. Comments!!! Comment your code. It will help you in the long run.
