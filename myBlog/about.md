> This blog is sort of like a running tab of my notes from classes and lectures I have attended, tutorials and books I have read on my journey to become a computer science ninja. I will also include post on projects I am currently working on. I hope that maybe the way I learn something or overcome a problem can help give some insight to others who are on the same journey. Please feel free to send me a message [here](mailto:jmsypkens@usfca.edu).
