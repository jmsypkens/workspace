// Week 3 Homework Due March 14, 2016 - Chapter 4, Exercise 12. Running the Race

// Write a program that asks for the names of three runners and the time it took each of them
// to ﬁnish a race. The program should display who came in ﬁrst, second, and third place.
// Think about how many test cases are needed to verify that your problem works correctly.
// (That is, how many different ﬁnish orders are possible?)
// Input Validation: Only allow the program to accept positive numbers for the times.
