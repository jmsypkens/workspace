This is where I am keeping my class files for intro to C++ 

Have a look at the files, and use the terminal to build them:

    $ make
    $ ./hello-c-world
    $ ./hello-cpp-world

We're sure you can take it from there. Go ahead and edit the code, 
or add some new files. It's all up to you! 

Happy coding!
